TCPDump is used to capture and analyze live network traffic.

1. To find all the interfaces that are available use:
    sudo tcpdump -D

2. Inspecting netword traffic of a network interface with tcpdump
    sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -v -c5
    Options:
      `-i`: used to select the interface
      `-v`: verbose 
      `-c5`: capture 5 packets of data

3. Saving captured data into a file
    sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nn -c9 port 80 -w capture.pcap &
    Options:
      `-i eth0`: Capture data from the eth0 interface.
      `-nn`: Do not attempt to resolve IP addresses or ports to names.This is best practice from a security perspective, as the lookup data may not be valid. It also prevents malicious actors from being alerted to an investigation.
      `-c9`: Capture 9 packets of data and then exit.
      `port 80`: Filter only port 80 traffic. This is the default HTTP port.
      `-w capture.pcap`: Save the captured data to the named file.
      `&`: This is an instruction to the Bash shell to run the command in the background.

    Generate some traffic traffic on the port 80 using curl 
    curl <url>

    verify the the captured packet:
    ls -l capture.pcap

4. Filtering the captured data:
    Filtering packet header data from the capture.pcap
    sudo tcpdump -nn -r capture.pcap -v
    Options:
      -nn: Disable port and protocol name lookup.
      -r: Read capture data from the named file.
      -v: Display detailed packet data.

    Filter extended packet data
    sudo tcpdump -nn -r capture.pcap -X
