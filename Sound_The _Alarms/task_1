Network Analysis and Monitoring

Wireshark a tool used to monitor the network traffic

Task 1:
Exploring packet data, key properties:  
    No. : The index number of the packet in this packet capture file
    Time: The timestamp of the packet
    Source: The source IP address
    Destination: The destination IP address
    Protocol: The protocol contained in the packet
    Length: The total length of the packet
    Info: Some infomation about the data in the packet (the payload) as interpreted by Wireshark

Applying filters:
Task 2:
Type into the apply filter bar: 
  ip.addr == <ip_address>
  This gives the traffic associated with the ip address.

Task 3:
Get the packets that come from the source
ip.src == <source_ip_address>

Get the packets according to the destination
ip.dst == <destination_ip_address>

Task 4:
Exploring DNS packets
udp.port == 53

Task 5:
Filter to explore TCP packets
tcp.port == 80

Task 4:
To get TCP packet that have specific data
tcp contains "specific data"
Eg: tcp contains "curl"
